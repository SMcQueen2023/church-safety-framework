- You bear the **entire risk** as to the results and performance of the materials.

## 3) Assumption of Risk; No Duty Owed

- {{AUTHOR_OR_ORG}} and contributors owe **no special duty** to you or your organization and do not undertake any obligation to update, monitor, or supervise your implementation.

## 4) Compliance Is Your Job
- **You must verify** that any policy or practice complies with all applicable **laws, regulations, codes, permits, and insurer requirements** for your jurisdiction(s).

## 5) Weapons & Use of Force
