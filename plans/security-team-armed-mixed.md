# {{CHURCH_NAME}} — Armed Security Volunteer Program (Mixed Model)
**Effective:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}  
**Maintainer:** {{SECURITY_LEAD_NAME}}, Security Team Lead  
**Review Cycle:** {{REVIEW_CYCLE}} (e.g., every 6–12 months)

> **Scope.** This addendum applies when **some security volunteers are armed** and **some serve unarmed**. It supplements the Security Team Plan and Use of Force Policy (§8).

---

## 1) Purpose
Enable a blended team that preserves a **de-escalation-first** posture while ensuring any armed volunteers meet elevated standards for **qualification, safety, and accountability**, and that **role clarity** prevents cross-purposes during incidents.

---

## 2) Role Definitions
- **Unarmed Security Volunteer (Default)** — observation, prevention, communication, crowd/egress control, liaison tasks, scene security for Medical; **no weapons carried**.
- **Armed Security Volunteer (By Exception)** — same duties as unarmed, **plus** a last-resort, lawful self-defense capability. Armed status requires explicit approval and strict compliance with this addendum.

---

## 3) Eligibility

### 3.1 Common (All Security Volunteers)
- Member/attendee in good standing; background screening per policy/insurer.
- Able to stand/walk for {{MIN_STAND_TIME}}; clear radio communication.
- Completed onboarding: orientation, radio discipline, **de-escalation**.

### 3.2 Unarmed Role (Default)
- **No weapons carried while serving.**
- Training: Orientation + **de-escalation**; **CPR/AED** recommended.
- Assignments: doors, lobby, aisles, escorts to pastoral care, scene security for Medical, meet-and-guide for EMS.

### 3.3 Armed Role (If Authorized)
> Armed status is **volunteer-by-volunteer** and **revocable** at any time.

**Legal & Administrative**
- **Valid Concealed Carry Permit** (or state equivalent) issued by **{{STATE}}**.
- Written approvals: {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}} and {{EXECUTIVE_PASTOR_TITLE}}, with {{INSURER_NAME}} concurrence.
- Signed acknowledgments of Security Plan, **Use of Force** (§8), this Addendum, and **LE Interaction** procedures.

**Training & Qualification (Meet all)**
- **POST or POST-Equivalent Pistol Qualification** with **{{ARMED_REQUAL_FREQ}}** requalification; scores recorded.
- **Holster Skills & Safety** certification (draw/re-holster, movement, malfunctions).
- **Legal** (state self-defense law; policy constraints); **De-escalation & Communications**.
- **Medical**: **Stop the Bleed** + **CPR/AED** (required).
- **Scenario Training**: shoot/no-shoot judgment; coordination with unarmed teammates.

**Disqualifiers (Examples)**
- Expired/invalid permit; failed or lapsed qualification; unsafe handling; policy violations; insurer objection; impairment.
- Failed background check.
- One or more policy violations.

---

## 4) Equipment Standards
- **Handgun only**, {{CALIBER_POLICY}}; reputable factory ammunition (no reloads on duty).
- **Holster**: Holster must be reasonably concealed per the discretion of the {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}}.
- **Spare magazine** recommended; weapon-mounted light allowed if trained.
- **Condition**: {{CARRY_CONDITION_POLICY}} (defined by program; e.g., chambered). Admin checks done privately off the floor.

---

## 5) Team Coordination (Mixed Ops)
- **Briefing (T-{{BRIEF_MINUTES}})** identifies armed personnel privately; assigns **clear tasks** that do **not depend** on being armed (e.g., entry posts, roving, LE liaison).
- **Contact & Containment** default to **unarmed tactics** (distance, barriers, options). Armed volunteers do **not** self-assign to confrontations; they follow SL direction.
- **LE Arrival:** All volunteers holster (if armed), **hands visible**, comply. **One** designated greeter meets LE at {{RESPONDER_ENTRY_POINT}}.

---

## 6) On-Shift Rules & Conduct
- Mission: **prevention, observation, reporting, and de-escalation**.  
- No investigatory detentions or hands-on escorts; preserve **time/distance** options.  
- Zero tolerance for alcohol/impairing drugs; disclose impairing prescriptions and stand down if needed.  
- No open carry unless explicitly approved and lawful; this program presumes **concealed** carry.

---

## 7) Use of Force (Summary; see Plan §8)
- **Self-defense only** against an **imminent** threat of death/serious bodily harm; **least-force-reasonable** under **{{STATE}}** law; cease when the threat ends.
- Immediate **911** for credible threats or any force event; scene preservation; objective facts to LE.

---

## 8) Documentation & Program Oversight
- **Incident Note** within **{{INCIDENT_NOTE_TIME}}**; **AAR** within **{{AAR_WINDOW}}** when incidents occur.  
- Maintain **secure records** of permits, quals, training dates/scores, approvals, and rosters.  
- **Armed roster review** every **{{ARMED_ROSTER_REVIEW_FREQ}}**; unarmed roster review at least annually.

---

## 9) Suspension/Revocation (Illustrative)
- Unsafe handling, ND, expired permit/qualification, policy breach, failure to comply with LE, dishonesty, insurer directive.
