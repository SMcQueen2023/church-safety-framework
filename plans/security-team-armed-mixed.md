# {{CHURCH_NAME}} — Armed Security Volunteer Program (Mixed Model)
**Effective:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}  
**Maintainer:** {{SECURITY_LEAD_NAME}}, Security Team Lead  
**Review Cycle:** {{REVIEW_CYCLE}} (e.g., every 6–12 months)

> **Scope.** This addendum applies when **some security volunteers are armed** and **some serve unarmed**. It fully defines **Use of Force** in §7 and aligns with FEMA/CISA houses-of-worship planning guidance and widely adopted de-escalation practices.

---

## 1) Purpose
Enable a blended team that preserves a **de-escalation-first** posture while ensuring any armed volunteers meet elevated standards for **qualification, safety, and accountability**, and that **role clarity** prevents cross-purposes during incidents.

---

## 2) Role Definitions
- **Unarmed Security Volunteer (Default)** — observation, prevention, communication, crowd/egress control, liaison tasks, scene security for Medical; **no weapons carried**.
- **Armed Security Volunteer (By Exception)** — same duties as unarmed, **plus** a last-resort, lawful self-defense capability. Armed status requires explicit approval and strict compliance with this addendum.

---

## 3) Eligibility & Training

### 3.1 Common (All Security Volunteers) — REQUIRED
- Member/attendee in good standing; background screening per policy/insurer.
- Able to stand/walk for {{MIN_STAND_TIME}}; clear radio communication.
- Completed onboarding: orientation, radio discipline, **de-escalation (verbal + time/distance/barriers)**.
- Signed **Code of Conduct**, LE interaction procedures, and acknowledgment of this addendum.

> **Note:** Common requirements apply to **everyone**, armed or unarmed.

---

### 3.2 Unarmed Role (Default) — REQUIRED FOR UNARMED
- **No weapons carried while serving.**
- **Training (Unarmed):**
  - Observation & reporting; crowd/egress control; escort to pastoral care.
  - **De-escalation** techniques appropriate for unarmed volunteers (disengage, call LE/Medical, preserve options).
  - **CPR/AED** recommended; **Stop the Bleed** optional (if carrying a tourniquet).
  - Scenario walk-throughs with Security/Medical/Parking; **LE arrival** posture (hands visible, follow directions).
- **Restrictions (Unarmed):**
  - No investigatory detentions, searches, or hands-on “escorts.”
  - Do not attempt to physically control subjects; maintain distance, call LE.

---

### 3.3 Armed Role (By Exception) — REQUIRED FOR ARMED
> Armed status is **volunteer-by-volunteer** and **revocable** at any time.

**Legal & Administrative (ARMED-ONLY)**
- **Valid Concealed Carry Permit** (or state equivalent) issued by **{{STATE}}**.
- Written approvals: {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}} and {{EXECUTIVE_PASTOR_TITLE}}, with {{INSURER_NAME}} concurrence.
- Signed acknowledgments of this Addendum, the **Use of Force** (§7), and LE interaction procedures.

**Training & Qualification (ARMED-ONLY — meet all)**
- **Handgun Qualification (marksmanship & handling):**
  - Pass a **documented course-of-fire** that **meets or exceeds** {{STATE}} POST pistol standards **or** an approved armed-security/military handgun qual of comparable **distance, target, time, accuracy**.
  - **Requalify** at least every **{{ARMED_REQUAL_FREQ}}** (e.g., 6–12 months); scores recorded.
  - **Note:** A concealed carry permit alone **does not** satisfy this skills requirement.
- **Holster Skills & Safety** (draw/re-holster, movement, malfunctions; strict muzzle/trigger discipline).
- **Legal & De-escalation (Armed):** {{STATE}} self-defense law; reporting; proportionality/necessity; decision-making under stress; radio brevity.
- **Medical:** **Stop the Bleed** + **CPR/AED** (required).
- **Scenario Training:** shoot/no-shoot judgment; **coordination with unarmed teammates**; **LE arrival** protocols.

**Disqualifiers (Not Exhaustive)**
- Expired/invalid permit (armed-only); failed/lapsed qualification (armed-only); unsafe handling (armed-only); policy violations; insurer objection; impairment; failed background check.

---

## 4) Equipment Standards (Armed Only)
- **Handgun only**, {{CALIBER_POLICY}}; reputable factory ammunition (**no reloads** on duty).
- **Holster**: must be **reasonably concealed** while serving, per discretion of the **{{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}}**. (A retention holster is **recommended**, not required.)
- Weapon-mounted light permitted if trained; **spare magazine** recommended.
- **Condition**: {{CARRY_CONDITION_POLICY}} (defined by program; e.g., chambered). Admin checks done privately off the floor.

---

## 5) Team Coordination (Mixed Ops)
- **Briefing (T-{{BRIEF_MINUTES}})** privately identifies armed personnel; assigns **clear tasks** that do **not depend** on being armed (entry posts, roving, LE liaison).
- **Contact & Containment** default to **unarmed tactics** (distance, barriers, options). Armed volunteers do **not** self-assign to confrontations; they follow SL direction.
- **LE Arrival:** All volunteers holster (if armed), **hands visible**, comply. **One** designated greeter meets LE at {{RESPONDER_ENTRY_POINT}} and guides units in.

---

## 6) On-Shift Rules & Conduct
- Mission: **prevention, observation, reporting, and de-escalation**.  
- No investigatory detentions or hands-on escorts; preserve **time/distance** options.  
- Zero tolerance for alcohol/impairing drugs; disclose impairing prescriptions and stand down if needed.  
- No open carry unless explicitly approved and lawful; this program presumes **concealed** carry.

## 7) Use of Force Policy (Volunteers) — Full Text

### 7.1 Principles
- **Preservation of life** is the highest priority.  
- **Self-defense only.** Volunteers are not sworn officers and do **not** enforce laws or detain except as permitted by law in genuine self-defense or defense of others.  
- **Objective reasonableness.** Force must be what a reasonable person would deem necessary under the totality of circumstances.  
- **Necessity & proportionality.** Use only the force necessary to stop an **imminent** threat of death or serious bodily injury; **cease** when the threat ends.  
- **De-escalation first** whenever feasible: communication, time, distance, barriers, repositioning, and coordination.

### 7.2 Definitions
- **Imminent threat:** A present capability and intent to cause death/serious bodily injury, with little to no time for alternatives.  
- **Deadly force:** Force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury.

### 7.3 Authorization — When Force May Be Used
- **Non-deadly force:** Volunteers avoid physical contact; non-deadly force is authorized only to the extent necessary for **immediate self-defense** and only if safe disengagement is not possible.  
- **Deadly force:** Authorized **only** to stop an **imminent** threat of death/serious bodily injury to the volunteer or another person.

### 7.4 Firearm Handling & Display
- **Unholstering/display:** Authorized when a volunteer **reasonably believes** a deadly-force threat is imminent or to **cover** a person who reasonably appears to pose such a threat.  
- **Low-ready:** Permitted when covering a suspected imminent threat while seeking compliance or awaiting LE, if backdrop and bystander risk are controlled.  
- **Pointing a firearm:** Only when the criteria for deadly-force readiness are met.  
- **Warning shots:** **Prohibited.**  
- **Shooting at/from moving vehicles:** **Strongly discouraged** and permitted only when no other option exists to address an **immediate** deadly threat and firing is not likely to endanger bystanders. If the vehicle is the only weapon and escape via movement is feasible, **do not fire**—move out of the path.

### 7.5 Prohibitions & Restrictions
- **No physical “escorts,”** chokeholds, carotid restraints, or pain-compliance techniques.  
- **No pursuit off church property.**  
- **No investigatory detentions** or searches.  
- **No negligent or reckless handling** (finger off trigger until decision to fire; muzzle discipline at all times).

### 7.6 Post-Incident Duties (after any display, pointing, or discharge)
1. **Stop the threat; then holster** when safe; **call 911** immediately.  
2. **Render aid** within training (Stop the Bleed/CPR) when safe to do so.  
3. **Preserve the scene**: do not disturb evidence beyond what’s necessary for safety/aid.  
4. **Identify to LE** when directed; comply with all instructions.  
5. **Notifications:** Inform {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}} as soon as safe; begin documentation (see §8).  
6. **No media statements**; direct inquiries to church leadership/counsel.

### 7.7 Reporting & Review
- **Incident Note** due within **{{INCIDENT_NOTE_TIME}}**: who/what/when/where, threat description, actions taken, witnesses, evidence preserved, notifications made.  
- **After-Action Review (AAR)** within **{{AAR_WINDOW}}** with leadership; determine training/policy updates.  
- **Administrative status:** {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}} may temporarily reassign or pause **armed status** pending review (unarmed service may continue at leadership’s discretion).

---

## 8) Documentation & Program Oversight
- **Incident Note** within **{{INCIDENT_NOTE_TIME}}**; **AAR** within **{{AAR_WINDOW}}** when incidents or near-misses occur.  
- Maintain **secure records** of permits, quals, training dates/scores, approvals, and rosters.  
- **Armed roster review** every **{{ARMED_ROSTER_REVIEW_FREQ}}**; unarmed roster review at least annually.

---

## 9) Suspension/Revocation
- Unsafe handling, negligent discharge, expired permit/qualification, policy breach, failure to comply with LE, dishonesty, insurer directive.
