# {{CHURCH_NAME}} — Armed Security Volunteer Program (All-Armed Model)
**Effective:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}  
**Maintainer:** {{SECURITY_LEAD_NAME}}, Security Team Lead  
**Review Cycle:** {{REVIEW_CYCLE}} (e.g., every 6–12 months)

> **Scope.** This addendum applies when **all active security volunteers are armed** while serving. It supplements the Security Team Plan and fully defines **Use of Force** in §6. It aligns with FEMA/CISA houses-of-worship planning guidance and widely adopted de-escalation practices.

---

## 1) Purpose
Provide a safe, lawful, and disciplined armed volunteer program suitable for a church environment that **prioritizes de-escalation** and **self-defense only**, ensures **qualification and accountability**, and enables **rapid, safe handoff** to law enforcement (LE).

---

## 2) Governance & Authorization
- **Authority.** Armed participation is granted by {{EXECUTIVE_PASTOR_TITLE}} upon recommendation of {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}} and concurrence from {{INSURER_NAME}}.
- **Revocability.** Authorization may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause or risk concerns.
- **Confidentiality.** Roster of armed volunteers is confidential on a need-to-know basis.
- **Planning integration.** This program is part of the church Emergency Operations Plan and drills with Medical, Parking, and local responders.

---

## 3) Eligibility (All Volunteers Serving on the Team)
> All security volunteers must meet these **armed** standards prior to serving.

### 3.1 Legal & Administrative
- **Valid Concealed Carry Permit** (or state equivalent) issued by **{{STATE}}**; carry must comply with all applicable laws.
- Not prohibited by law or policy from possessing/carrying a firearm.
- Background screening per church policy/insurer requirements.
- Signed acknowledgments of this Addendum, **Use of Force** (§6), LE interaction procedures, and required training.

### 3.2 Training & Qualification (meet **all**)
- **Handgun Qualification (marksmanship & handling):**  
  - Pass a **documented course-of-fire** that **meets or exceeds** {{STATE}} POST pistol standards **or** an approved armed-security/military handgun qualification of comparable **distance, target, time, and accuracy**.  
  - **Requalify** at least every **{{ARMED_REQUAL_FREQ}}** (e.g., 6–12 months). Scores and dates recorded.  
  - **Note:** A concealed carry permit alone **does not** satisfy this skills requirement.
- **Holster Skills & Safety:** Safe draw/re-holster, movement, malfunctions; strict muzzle/trigger discipline.
- **Legal Block:** {{STATE}} self-defense law, reporting requirements, LE coordination, church policy limits; emphasize necessity, proportionality, and reasonableness.
- **De-escalation & Communications:** Verbal tactics, decision-making under stress, team comms/radio brevity; annual refresh recommended.
- **Medical Block:** **Stop the Bleed** + **CPR/AED** (required for armed volunteers).
- **Scenario Training:** Shoot/no-shoot judgment, threat ID, post-incident actions, LE arrival coordination.

### 3.3 Disqualifiers (examples)
- Expired/invalid permit; failed or lapsed qualification; unsafe handling; policy violations; insurer objection; impairment; failed background screening.

---

## 4) Equipment Standards
- **Handgun only**, {{CALIBER_POLICY}}; reputable factory ammunition (**no reloads** on duty).
- **Holster (reverted policy):** The holster **must be reasonably concealed** while serving, **per the discretion of the {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}}**. (A retention holster is **recommended** but **not required**.)
- Weapon-mounted light permitted if trained; **spare magazine** recommended.
- **Carry condition:** {{CARRY_CONDITION_POLICY}} (defined by program; e.g., chambered). Administrative checks are private and off the floor.

---

## 5) On-Shift Rules & Conduct
- **Mission priority:** protection, observation, reporting, and **de-escalation**—not enforcement.
- **No hands-on escorts** or investigatory detentions; maintain **time, distance, barriers**; call LE when needed.
- **Zero tolerance** for alcohol/impairing drugs. Disclose any medication that may impair; do not serve if impaired.
- **Identification to LE:** On LE arrival—**holster, hands visible, comply**. Identify as church security when directed.
- **Sensitive areas:** Coordinate with children’s ministry leads for posture appropriate to those spaces.

## 6) Use of Force Policy (Volunteers) — Full Text

### 6.1 Principles
- **Preservation of life** is the highest priority.  
- **Self-defense only.** Volunteers are not sworn officers and do **not** enforce laws or detain except as permitted by law in genuine self-defense or defense of others.
- **Objective reasonableness.** Any force must be what a reasonable person would deem necessary under the totality of circumstances.
- **Necessity & proportionality.** Use only the force necessary to stop an **imminent** threat of death or serious bodily injury; **cease** when the threat ends.
- **De-escalation first** whenever feasible: communication, time, distance, barriers, repositioning, and coordination.

### 6.2 Definitions
- **Imminent threat:** A present capability and intent to cause death/serious bodily injury, with little to no time for alternatives.  
- **Deadly force:** Force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury.

### 6.3 Authorization — When Force May Be Used
- **Non-deadly force:** Volunteers avoid physical contact; non-deadly force is authorized only to the extent necessary for **immediate self-defense** and then only if safe disengagement is not possible.  
- **Deadly force:** Authorized **only** to stop an **imminent** threat of death/serious bodily injury to the volunteer or another person.

### 6.4 Firearm Handling & Display
- **Unholstering/display:** Authorized when a volunteer **reasonably believes** a deadly-force threat is imminent or to **cover** a person who reasonably appears to pose such a threat.  
- **Low-ready:** Permitted when covering a suspected imminent threat while seeking compliance or awaiting LE, if backdrop and bystander risk are controlled.  
- **Pointing a firearm:** Only when the criteria for deadly-force readiness are met.  
- **Warning shots:** **Prohibited.**  
- **Shooting at/from moving vehicles:** **Strongly discouraged** and permitted only when no other option exists to address an **immediate** deadly threat and firing is not likely to endanger bystanders. If the vehicle is the only weapon and escape via movement is feasible, **do not fire**—move out of the path.

### 6.5 Prohibitions & Restrictions
- **No physical “escorts,”** chokeholds, carotid restraints, or pain-compliance techniques.  
- **No pursuit off church property.**  
- **No investigatory detentions** or searches.  
- **No negligent or reckless handling** (finger off trigger until decision to fire; muzzle discipline at all times).

### 6.6 Post-Incident Duties (after any display, pointing, or discharge)
1. **Stop the threat; then holster** when safe; **call 911** immediately.  
2. **Render aid** within training (Stop the Bleed/CPR) when safe to do so.  
3. **Preserve the scene**: do not disturb evidence beyond what’s necessary for safety/aid.  
4. **Identify to LE** when directed; comply with all instructions.  
5. **Notifications:** Inform {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}} as soon as safe; begin documentation (see §8).  
6. **No media statements**; direct inquiries to church leadership/counsel.

### 6.7 Reporting & Review
- **Incident Note** due within **{{INCIDENT_NOTE_TIME}}**: who/what/when/where, threat description, actions taken, witnesses, evidence preserved, notifications made.  
- **After-Action Review (AAR)** within **{{AAR_WINDOW}}** with leadership; determine training/policy updates.  
- **Administrative status:** {{SECURITY_LEAD_TITLE}} may temporarily reassign or pause armed status pending review.

---

## 7) Coordination & Safety Controls
- **Pre-shift brief** ({{BRIEF_MINUTES}} before service): posts, comms, identifiers, medical/LE entry point {{RESPONDER_ENTRY_POINT}}.
- **Parking:** maintain **EMS/fire lane**; quick path for responding units; escort as assigned.
- **Medical:** scene security, crowd control, and evidence preservation; immediate lifesaving aid if safe.
- **Suspicious items/behaviors:** Do **not** touch suspected devices; create space, notify 911, and follow bomb-threat principles.

---

## 8) Documentation & Reviews
- **Incident Note** submitted within **{{INCIDENT_NOTE_TIME}}** (e.g., same day).  
- **After-Action Review** within **{{AAR_WINDOW}}** for incidents or near-misses; capture lessons and update plan.  
- **Records kept:** permit status, training, qualifications, approvals, and AARs.  
- **Roster review** every **{{ARMED_ROSTER_REVIEW_FREQ}}**.

---

## 9) Suspension/Revocation Triggers (illustrative)
- Unsafe gun handling, negligent discharge, expired permit/qualification, policy breach, failure to comply with LE on scene, dishonesty in documentation, insurer directive.
