## 1) Purpose
Provide a safe, lawful, and disciplined armed volunteer program suitable for a church environment that **prioritizes de-escalation** and **self-defense only**, ensures **qualification and accountability**, and enables **rapid, safe handoff** to law enforcement (LE).

- **Revocability.** Authorization may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause or risk concerns.
- **Confidentiality.** Roster of armed volunteers is confidential on a need-to-know basis.

---

## 5) On-Shift Rules & Conduct
- **Mission priority:** protection, observation, reporting, and **de-escalation**—not enforcement.

- **De-escalate when feasible**; cease force when threat ends.
- **Prohibited**: negligent handling; any technique or action barred by policy (e.g., chokeholds unless deadly force would be lawful—confirm with counsel/insurer).
- **Mandatory notifications**: 911 promptly for credible threats or force events; secure scene; provide objective facts.

---

## 7) Coordination & Safety Controls
- **Pre-shift brief** ({{BRIEF_MINUTES}} before service): posts, comms, identifiers, medical/LE entry point {{RESPONDER_ENTRY_POINT}}.
- **Parking**: maintain **EMS/fire lane**; quick path for responding units; escort as assigned.
