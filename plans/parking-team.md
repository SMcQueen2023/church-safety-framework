# {{CHURCH_NAME}} — Parking Team Plan
**Effective:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}  
**Maintainer:** {{PARKING_LEAD_NAME}}, Parking Team Lead  
**Review Cycle:** {{REVIEW_CYCLE}} (e.g., every 12 months)

> **Disclaimer:** This plan provides operational guidance for **volunteer** attendants at a house of worship. It is not legal advice. Adapt to your jurisdiction, insurer requirements, and property layout.

---

## 1) Purpose
Provide safe, predictable **vehicle and pedestrian flow**, reduce collision risk and secondary incidents, and ensure **clear emergency access/egress** for EMS and fire. Concepts align with FHWA **Traffic Incident Management (TIM)** and “**Quick Clearance**” good practice, adapted to private property operations. [FHWA TIM; FHWA Quick Clearance]

---

## 2) Scope
Covers all **exterior approaches, entrances, lots, drop-offs, crosswalks, and sidewalks** during:
- Sunday services ({{SERVICE_TIMES}}), mid-week activities, and special events  
- Pre-service arrival through post-dismissal windows  
- Joint operations with **Security** (perimeter, incidents) and **Medical** (EMS routing) [FEMA HoW EOP]

---

## 3) Eligibility
- Situational awareness; able to stand and signal safely in all weather  
- Comfortable with radio communication and using **consistent hand/flashlight signals**  
- Reliable, calm demeanor; follows direction under stress

---

## 4) Attire & Equipment
- **High-visibility vest** (required); weather-appropriate footwear/gloves  
- **Two-way radio with earpiece**; whistle (optional)  
- **Flashlight or traffic wand** after dusk/low light  
- Cones/signs per lot plan; keep **EMS/fire lane** coned but removable

> Use consistent, obvious signals and never step into a live lane to “force” a stop. MUTCD principles for temporary traffic control and pedestrian priority inform these practices, even on private property. [MUTCD 11th Ed.]

---

## 5) Training & Exercises
- Lot layout, choke-points, ADA/accessible parking plan, and **pedestrian priority** rules  
- Radio brevity: **location first**, plain English  
- **TIM basics** (awareness level): safe positioning, advance warning, and **quick-clearance** mindset to reduce secondary crashes for minor, non-injury fender-benders (when safe and lawful). [FHWA Quick Clearance]  
- **Integrated drills** with Security & Medical **every {{DRILL_FREQ}}** to validate the EMS route {{EMS_ROUTE}} and entry point {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}}. [FEMA HoW EOP; CISA HoW]

## 6) Sunday Serve Procedure

### 6.1 Timeline
- **T-{{PREP_MIN}} (e.g., 30)** — Set cones/signs per lot plan; radio check; confirm **EMS/fire lane** is open; verify {{ACCESS_GATE_KEYS}} on hand  
- **Arrival window** — Direct vehicles to rows; protect crosswalks and drop-off; call overflow when {{PRIMARY_LOT_THRESHOLD}}% full  
- **Service in progress ({{SERVICE_LENGTH}})** — Light presence at entries; watch for hazards; keep responder lane clear  
- **Dismissal (0–{{DISMISS_MIN}})** — Stage at conflict points; coordinate staggered releases with Security; remove/add cones as needed for flow  
- **Post (+{{DEBRIEF_MIN}})** — Collect cones/signs; note hazards/damage; quick debrief

### 6.2 Activities
- **Flow control:** Fill nearest rows first for arrivals; during dismissal, release far rows first if needed to reduce crossing conflicts  
- **Pedestrian priority:** Eye contact, clear gestures; pause vehicles rather than sending people into moving lanes  
- **Drop-off protection:** Keep loop moving; no unattended vehicles; overflow to {{OVERFLOW_AREA}} on cue  
- **Hazard spotting:** Disabled vehicles, debris, aggressive driving; call Security; if injury suspected, request Medical/911  
- **Responder access:** Keep {{EMS_ROUTE}} and {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}} clear at all times

### 6.3 Responsibilities
- **Parking Lead (PL):** Staffing, lot plan execution, LE/EMS staging liaison  
- **Attendants:** Row/aisle flow, pedestrian crossings, hazard reporting, cone/sign resets  
- **EMS Guide (as assigned):** Meets EMS at {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}}, escorts via {{EMS_ROUTE}}; coordinates with Security

## 7) Traffic Incident Procedure (On Church Property)
> Goal: **Protect people first**, then **restore safe flow** quickly if there are **no injuries** and it is **safe** to move vehicles.

1. **Protect the scene—your safety first.** Do **not** stand in live lanes. From a protected position, set **advance warning** (cones) if safe to do so; call Security with concise location and status. [FHWA TIM]  
2. **Quick-clearance (minor, no injury).** If safe and lawful, **guide vehicles out of travel lanes** (to a stall/shoulder area) to reduce secondary crashes and restore flow; exchange info off the main path. [FHWA Quick Clearance]  
3. **Potential injury/uncertain mechanism.** **Do not** move injured persons; call **Medical/911**; keep access open for EMS; assign an **EMS Guide** to {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}}.  
4. **Information & handoff.** Provide basic facts to Security/LE (location, vehicles, visible hazards). Resume flow when cleared.

> Notes: “Quick clearance” practices (e.g., *Move It/Steer It, Clear It*) vary by state; volunteers operate on private property but **adopt the same safety intent**—reduce secondary crashes without interfering with investigations or care. Coordinate with local LE on expectations. [FHWA Quick Clearance; IACP Quick Clearance Toolkit]

## 8) Documentation & Quality Improvement
- **Incident Note** within **{{INCIDENT_NOTE_TIME}}** for collisions, injuries, or 911 calls (who/what/when/where, actions taken, handoffs)  
- **After-Action Review (AAR)** within **{{AAR_WINDOW}}** for significant events or recurring hazards; update lot plan/cone map as needed [FEMA HoW EOP]  
- Maintain an **exterior hazards log** (lighting outages, potholes, signage issues) for Facilities follow-up
