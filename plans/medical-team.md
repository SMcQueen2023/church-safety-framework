# {{CHURCH_NAME}} — Medical Team Plan
**Effective:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}  
**Maintainer:** {{MEDICAL_LEAD_NAME}}, Medical Team Lead  
**Review Cycle:** {{REVIEW_CYCLE}} (e.g., every 12 months)

> **Disclaimer:** This plan provides operational guidance for **volunteer** responders at a house of worship. It is not medical or legal advice. Adapt to your jurisdiction, insurer requirements, and medical direction if available.

---

## 1) Purpose
Provide rapid, compassionate, and competent first response for illness or injury on {{CAMPUS_NAME}} property, emphasizing the **AHA Out-of-Hospital Chain of Survival** for cardiac arrest, early hemorrhage control (ACS **Stop the Bleed**), and a fast, safe **handoff to EMS**. [AHA Guidelines; AHA Chain; ACS STB]

---

## 2) Scope
Covers all interiors/exteriors during:
- Sunday services ({{SERVICE_TIMES}}), mid-week activities, and special events.  
- Pre-service arrival through post-dismissal windows.  
- Joint operations with **Security** (scene safety, access control) and **Parking** (EMS route and staging). [FEMA HoW EOP]

---

## 3) Eligibility
- Current **CPR/AED** certification (AHA or equivalent).  
- **Stop the Bleed** course recommended for any responder carrying a tourniquet.  
- Professional licenses (RN/EMT/MD/PA, etc.) are welcome but **not required** for basic volunteer roles.  
- Able to stand/walk for {{MIN_STAND_TIME}} and carry a responder kit.

---

## 4) Attire & Equipment
- Discreet identifier (badge/armband).  
- **Responder kit**: nitrile gloves (multiple pairs), CPR mask, trauma shears, pressure dressings, gauze, hemostatic gauze (if stocked), tourniquet (if trained), space blanket.  
- **AEDs** placed for **≤3–5 minute** collapse-to-shock where feasible; locations posted and mapped: {{AED_LOCATIONS_MAP_URL}}. [AHA AED Guide]

---

## 5) Training & Exercises
- **CPR/AED**: certification and refreshers per card; emphasize high-quality compressions and rapid defibrillation. [AHA Guidelines; AHA Chain]  
- **Bleeding control**: direct pressure → wound packing → tourniquet (“high and tight”) for life-threatening limb bleeding; hands-on practice. [ACS STB/Hartford]  
- **Integrated drills** with Security & Parking **every {{DRILL_FREQ}}** (tabletop or walk-through) to validate radio flow, EMS routing, and entry point {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}}. [FEMA HoW EOP]  
- **AED program maintenance**: battery/pad checks, signage, response targets, and documentation. [AHA AED Program]

---

## 6) Sunday Serve Procedure

### 6.1 Timeline
- **T-{{PREP_MIN}} (e.g., 30)** — **Brief & Readiness**  
  - Roll call; radio check; AED green-light status; kits verified; assign zones (Sanctuary, Lobby, Children’s, Parking).
- **Service In-Progress ({{SERVICE_LENGTH}})** — **Quiet Rove & Stage**  
  - Position near high-risk areas; minimize disruption; ensure clear egress for EMS.
- **Dismissal (0–{{DISMISS_MIN}})** — **High-Density Watch**  
  - Cover exits, stairs, nursery pickup; coordinate with Security for crowd control.
- **Post Service (+{{DEBRIEF_MIN}})** — **Debrief & Reset**  
  - Note incidents, kit restock, AED status, and follow-ups.

### 6.2 Role Assignments
- **Medical Lead (ML):** Scene medical command, treatment priority calls, EMS liaison, documentation approval.  
- **Responder(s):** Assessment, interventions within training, concise radio updates (“Patient, Lobby, unresponsive, CPR in progress”).  
- **Guide/Greeter:** Meets EMS at {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}}; escorts to patient; clears elevator/doors.  
- **Security Liaison:** Maintains perimeter, controls crowd, preserves scene. (See Security Plan.)

---

## 7) Scene Management & Safety
- **You first**: don gloves; ensure scene is safe; request **Security** for space/crowd control.  
- **Privacy & dignity**: shield patient from view as feasible; limit bystanders.  
- **Clean egress**: coordinate with **Parking** to keep EMS/fire lane open and to guide the ambulance from {{EMS_ROUTE}} to {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}}.

> Medical care steps are governed by each volunteer’s **training and certification** (e.g., AHA CPR/AED, ACS Stop the Bleed) and **local protocols**, not by this document. [AHA Guidelines; ACS STB]

---

## 8) Documentation & Quality Improvement
- **Incident Note** within **{{INCIDENT_NOTE_TIME}}** (facts only: who/what/when/where, vitals if measured, interventions, times, to whom handed off).  
- **After-Action Review (AAR)** within **{{AAR_WINDOW}}** for significant events (e.g., CPR, severe bleeding, 911 activation). Capture lessons, kit changes, signage needs, training gaps. [FEMA HoW EOP]  
- **AED data**: download/retain if available; document battery/pad replacement and device status. [AHA AED Program]

---

## 9) AED Program Standards
- **Response target**: collapse-to-shock **≤3–5 minutes** where feasible.  
- **Placement**: near high-density areas and barriers (balcony, lobby, children’s wing).  
- **Maintenance**: {{AED_CHECK_FREQ}} visual checks; pads/battery tracked with **reminder before expiry**; signage visible; responders trained/recertified.  
- **Program file**: device serials, pad/battery expirations, training roster, drill/AAR log, and policy approvals kept by {{MEDICAL_LEAD_NAME}}. [AHA AED Guide (2023 update)]

---

## 10) Legal & Privacy Notes (Volunteers)
- **Good Samaritan protections** may apply to lay rescuers acting in good faith; verify {{STATE}} specifics with counsel/insurer.  
- **HIPAA** typically does **not** apply to churches as they are not covered entities, but **respect confidentiality**: share only what EMS needs; store incident notes securely; avoid PII in public channels.

---

## 11) Coordination with Security & Parking
- **Security**: establishes warm zone, protects egress, preserves scene for LE if injury/crime; escorts family as appropriate.  
- **Parking**: clears **EMS/fire lane**, moves cones, meets ambulance, unlocks gates, and escorts EMS via {{EMS_ROUTE}} to {{EMS_ENTRY_POINT}}.

---

## 12) Readiness Checklists

### 12.1 Pre-Service (T-{{PREP_MIN}})
- Radios/earpieces issued and checked  
- AEDs “ready” indicators green; pads/battery in date  
- Kits stocked (gloves ×4+, dressings, gauze, shears, tourniquet if trained)  
- Zones assigned; EMS entry point confirmed

### 12.2 Post-Service (+{{DEBRIEF_MIN}})
- Restock kits; wipe/clean as needed  
- AED status verified; data pulled if used  
- Incident notes filed; AAR scheduled if required
